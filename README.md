# Crime_pattern_analysis
This project investigates the use of Tableau, a strong data visualization tool, in conjunction with Python code for the PrefixSpan machine learning algorithm to identify repeating sequential patterns in crime datasets. The study discusses the critical need for efficient and informative crime analysis methodologies by combining modern analytics, dynamic visualization approaches, and machine learning techniques. The research highlights how Tableau's capabilities, coupled with Python code for the PrefixSpan algorithm, help law enforcement organizations discover hidden patterns, trends, and correlations among vast crime datasets. This project is significant because of its potential to change criminal investigation tactics, improve resource allocation, and ultimately lead to safer communities. This innovative approach provides authorities with a comprehensive collection of tools for data-driven decision-making, resulting in more successful crime prevention and law enforcement initiatives.

This dashboard, leveraging Tableau, offers users an in-depth exploration of crime occurrence statistics. It allows viewers to discern connections between different datasets, enriching their comprehension of crime patterns and promoting informed decision-making. By consolidating multiple visualizations into a unified dashboard, users can readily pinpoint critical areas of concern and devise targeted strategies for intervention. Additionally, the dashboard features a visual representation of crime occurrences in each area, providing a clear depiction of the spatial distribution of crime incidents. This visualization enhances users' understanding of localized crime trends, facilitating more effective allocation of resources and implementation of crime prevention measures.
Below, you will find additional visualizations of crime data for comprehensive analysis and understanding.

The following explanation delineates the functionality of the code in identifying recurring crime patterns within a large dataset. Initially, the code retrieves the dataset from Google Drive, which serves as the foundation for subsequent Python operations. Subsequently, data cleansing procedures are implemented, ensuring data integrity and formatting consistency. Finally, the code seamlessly identifies sequential patterns within the intricate and expansive dataset, streamlining the process for enhanced efficiency and accuracy.
Below are the results generated by the Python code, illustrating the recurring crime patterns identified within the dataset.

In the output provided, the dataset is initially displayed in its entirety. Subsequently, the output presents 50 recurring patterns that have been identified to repeat at least 100 times within the dataset, as specified by the "min_support" variable in the program. This parameter allows for customization according to user preference. For instance, in the output:

1. Pattern: 119, Support: [624]
2. Pattern: 119, Support: [624, 'BATTERY - SIMPLE ASSAULT']
3. Pattern: 107, Support: [624, 'BATTERY - SIMPLE ASSAULT', 'Invest Cont']
4. Pattern: 107, Support: [624, 'Invest Cont']

Each pattern is accompanied by its respective support value, denoting the frequency of occurrence within the dataset. In the first pattern, for example, the dataset value "624" repeats 119 times. In subsequent patterns, additional descriptors such as crime descriptions are included, indicating the combined occurrence of specific crime codes and descriptions. 

This flexibility in setting the "min_support" parameter allows users to refine their analysis based on different thresholds. By leveraging the PrefixSpan sequential pattern algorithm, navigating through complex datasets becomes considerably streamlined, facilitating the identification of intricate patterns with ease.
